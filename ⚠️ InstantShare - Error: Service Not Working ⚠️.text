🚨 InstantShare is Currently Not Working! 🚨

Hey there! 👋 Unfortunately, InstantShare is not working right now due to API issues. 🚫 Our API server is currently offline, which is causing the platform to be unreachable.

🔧 Reasons for the downtime:
⚡ API server is down – The backend is not running, so text/link sharing isn't working.
🕐 Temporary hosting on Replit – Right now, the API runs for a short time only, not 24/7.
🚀 Looking for a better solution – Soon, I’ll try to host the API 24/7 for smooth access.
🌐 Other possible issues – There might be server overload, maintenance, or network problems affecting the service.

💡 What’s next?
I’m working on bringing the server back online as soon as possible! Stay tuned for updates. 🚀
